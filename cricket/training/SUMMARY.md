## 🏗️ Architecture Details

### Model Components
- **Encoder**: Processes match history (up to 128 balls)
- **Decoder**: Generates next over predictions
- **Parameters**: 5.5M (small config) to 25M+ (large config)
- **Input**: 18D ball vectors + 20D context vectors
- **Output**: 24-token cricket vocabulary

### Key Features
- **Variable Length Sequences**: Handles 1-128 ball histories
- **Positional Encoding**: Maintains sequence order
- **Attention Masking**: Proper padding handling
- **Causal Masking**: Prevents future information leakage
- **Context Injection**: Current match state integration

## 🚀 Ready to Train

### Quick Start
```bash
# Test the model (already passed!)
python training/quick_test.py

# Start training with small config (recommended first)
python training/run.py train --config small --epochs 20

# Or full training
python training/trainer.py
```

### Training Configurations

| Config | Parameters | Memory | Use Case |
|--------|------------|--------|----------|
| `small` | ~2M | ~50MB | Testing/Development |
| `base` | ~10M | ~100MB | Production |
| `large` | ~25M | ~200MB | Maximum Performance |
| `fast` | ~1.5M | ~40MB | Quick Experiments |

## 📈 Expected Training Performance

Based on your data analysis:

### Training Feasibility: ✅ EXCELLENT
- **Dataset**: 37,397 sequences (substantial)
- **Features**: Rich 18D+20D feature vectors
- **Memory**: <100MB per batch (MPS friendly)
- **Training Time**: 2-4 hours on Apple Silicon
- **Convergence**: Expected good results

### Performance Targets
- **Token Accuracy**: 70-85%
- **Exact Match**: 20-40%
- **Perplexity**: <3.0
- **Training Loss**: Should decrease to <1.5

## 🎯 Training Strategy

### Phase 1: Teacher Forcing (50% of epochs)
- Model learns from ground truth
- Stable, fast convergence
- Builds cricket pattern understanding

### Phase 2: Autonomous Training (50% of epochs)
- Model uses own predictions
- Learns error recovery
- Improves real-world performance

## 🖥️ Apple Silicon Optimization

### MPS Features
- **Automatic Detection**: Uses MPS when available
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized batch sizes
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback strategies
- **Tensor Compatibility**: Automatic dtype conversion

### Performance Tips
- **Batch Size**: 16 works well for MPS
- **Model Size**: Start with 'base' config
- **Monitoring**: Use Activity Monitor for memory
- **Cooling**: Ensure good ventilation

## 🎮 Next Steps

### 1. Start Training
```bash
# Recommended: Start with small config
python training/run.py train --config small --epochs 20

# Monitor progress
tensorboard --logdir training/runs/
```

### 2. Monitor Training
- Watch loss decrease
- Check token accuracy improvement
- Verify no overfitting (val loss follows train loss)

### 3. Evaluate Results
- Test on validation set
- Generate sample predictions
- Compare with actual cricket outcomes

### 4. Scale Up
- If small config works well, try 'base' config
- Increase epochs for better performance
