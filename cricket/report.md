# Cricket Prediction Analysis Report üèè

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of an experiment to evaluate how well an AI model can predict cricket outcomes. We tested the model's ability to predict what happens in cricket overs by comparing its predictions with actual match data from 5 real cricket matches.

---

## üéØ What We Tested

### The Experiment Setup

- **Matches Analyzed**: 5 complete cricket matches
- **Total Overs Studied**: 100 overs (20 overs per match)
- **Predictions Per Over**: 20 different predictions for each over
- **Total Predictions Made**: 2,000 individual predictions

### What We Measured

For each over, we asked the AI model to predict:

1. **Will there be a wicket?** (Yes/No prediction)
2. **What types of runs will be scored?** (Singles, twos, fours, sixes, etc.)
3. **How many total runs will be scored?** (Numerical prediction)

We then compared these predictions with what actually happened in the real matches.

## üìä Key Findings

### 1. Wicket Predictions

**Overall Wicket Prediction Accuracy: 62.7%**

- The model correctly predicted whether an over would have a wicket or not about **63% of the time**
- Performance varied significantly (ranging from 10% to 95% accuracy across different overs)

**Critical Finding - Wicket Detection When Wickets Actually Occurred:**

Out of 24 overs that actually had wickets:
- The model only predicted wickets correctly **34.4% of the time**
- This means when a wicket actually fell, the model missed it about **2 out of 3 times**

### 2. Run Type Predictions

The model's ability to predict specific types of scoring varied dramatically:

| Run Type | Accuracy |
|----------|----------|
| **Singles (1 run)** | 89.8% |
| **Threes (3 runs)** | 86.0% | 
| **Fives (5 runs)** | 96.1% | 
| **Sixes (6 runs)** | 60.8% | 
| **Fours (4 runs)** | 48.1% |
| **Twos (2 runs)** | 53.8% | 



### 3. Total Runs Prediction

**Major Over-Prediction Problem Identified:**

- **Actual runs scored**: 754 runs (7.54 runs per over average)
- **Model predicted**: 1,115 runs (11.15 runs per over average)
- **Over-prediction**: Model predicted **47.8% more runs** than actually occurred
- **Average error**: 4.89 runs per over too high

## üèè Match-by-Match Performance

### Match Breakdown

| Match ID | Wicket Accuracy | Wicket Detection Rate* | Actual Runs | Predicted Runs | Over-Prediction |
|----------|----------------|----------------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| 215 | 63.0% | 38.0% | 197 | 227 | +30 runs |
| 1829 | 62.3% | 38.0% | 134 | 228 | +94 runs |
| 1583 | 61.5% | 34.2% | 137 | 228 | +91 runs |
| 657 | 63.0% | 32.0% | 163 | 221 | +58 runs |
| 1347 | 63.8% | 26.7% | 123 | 212 | +89 runs |

*Wicket Detection Rate = When there was actually a wicket, how often did the model predict it?

## üîç Detailed Analysis

### What the Model Does Well

1. **Consistent Overall Performance**: All matches showed similar wicket prediction accuracy (61-64%)
2. **Good at Common Events**: 90% accuracy for predicting single runs
3. **Stable Predictions**: Low variation in prediction confidence

### Critical Weaknesses

1. **Missed Wickets**: Fails to detect actual wickets 66% of the time
2. **Systematic Over-prediction**: Consistently predicts too many runs per over
3. **Run Total Accuracy**: Average error of nearly 5 runs per over

## üéØ Statistical Significance

### Confidence in Results

- **Sample Size**: 2,000 individual predictions provide high statistical confidence
- **Consistency**: Results were consistent across all 5 matches tested
- **Range of Scenarios**: 100 overs covered various match situations

### Key Metrics Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall Accuracy | 62.7% ¬± 20.8% | 
| Wicket Detection | 34.4% ¬± 14.4% | 
| Run Over-prediction | +47.8% | 
| Singles Accuracy | 89.8% | 
| Boundaries Accuracy | 54.5% avg |

## üí° Practical Implications

### For Cricket Analysis

1. **Reliable for Singles**: The model can be trusted for predicting single-run scenarios
2. **Unreliable for Wickets**: Cannot be used for wicket-taking predictions in critical situations
3. **Biased Run Totals**: Systematically over-estimates scoring rates

### For Model Development

1. **Wicket Detection**: Major improvement needed in identifying wicket-taking deliveries
2. **Boundary Prediction**: Requires better understanding of boundary-scoring patterns
3. **Calibration**: Needs adjustment to reduce systematic over-prediction bias

---

## üîÆ Conclusions

### Model Strengths
- Consistent performance across different matches
- Excellent at predicting routine events (singles)
- Good at identifying rare scoring patterns

### Critical Areas for Improvement
- **Wicket prediction accuracy** - Currently misses 2 out of 3 actual wickets
- **Boundary scoring prediction** - Poor performance on fours and sixes
- **Run total calibration** - Systematically over-predicts by ~5 runs per over

### Overall Assessment
The model shows promise for certain cricket prediction tasks but has significant limitations that prevent it from being reliable for comprehensive cricket analysis. The systematic over-prediction of runs and poor wicket detection rate are particular concerns that need addressing before practical deployment.
